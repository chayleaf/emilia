A very simple SAT solver. My goal is experimenting with creating a
declarative module system, which requires finding an arrangement that
satisfies all of the modules' requirements (e.g. the ordering that the
modules requested is satisfied, there are no conflicting values, etc). I
may end up using something other than SAT for that purpose, so I suppose
this will be my area for theorem proving experimentation.
